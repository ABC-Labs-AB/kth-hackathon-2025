# 📄 Project Report Format Guide

## 📝 Introduction to Written Submission Format

The written submission is an **essential part** of your hackathon deliverables. It allows you to articulate your project’s journey, the decisions you made, the challenges you faced, and the impact your solution can bring. This document gives the judges a comprehensive view of your approach and understanding of the problem, as well as your technical and strategic skills.

To ensure **clarity and consistency** across submissions, please structure your report using the five main sections outlined below. Each section guides you to explain critical aspects of your project, from the initial motivation to your future plans. We encourage you to be concise yet thorough, providing enough detail for the evaluation team to appreciate your work.

Use this template as a roadmap to showcase not only what you achieved but also how you thought through the process and how your solution integrates with real-world applications.

## 📌 1. Motivation  
🔍 What problem did you decide to solve? What motivated your team to choose this challenge?

## ⚙️ 2. Preprocessing  
⚡ Describe all preprocessing steps your team decided to take. Explain why these steps were necessary and how they prepared the data for training.

## 🚀 3. Training and Evaluation  
📊 Provide a detailed explanation of your training process and how you evaluated your model. What metrics did you use and why?

## 🔗 4. Implementation Strategy  
🛠️ How do you intend your model to be used within our existing work pipeline? Describe the planned operational role and integration approach.
⏱️ Please include estimations on efficiency gains, such as how much time your model could save compared to manual evaluation.

## ❌ 5. Challenges and Next Steps  
- 🚧 What did you try but eventually discard? Why did you decide to abandon those approaches?  
- 🌱 If your solution only addresses part of the problem, how would you extend it to cover the rest?  
- 🎯 What would be your next step if you had more time or resources to improve the model?
