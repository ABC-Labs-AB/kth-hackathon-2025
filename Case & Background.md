# üîç Case & Background

The methods developed in our lab are specifically designed for **workplace drug testing**. We have created three distinct analytical methods to meet our diverse business requirements. The goal of these tests is to determine whether a donor‚Äôs biological sample contains any prohibited substances that could pose a risk in their workplace. Each donor sample is tested for multiple analytes simultaneously.

A **negative sample** means none of the targeted analytes are detected in the donor‚Äôs blood or urine above the defined cutoff levels. Conversely, a **positive sample** indicates that at least one analyte is present at a concentration exceeding the established threshold.

## Usual Workflow

Donor samples are collected using our specialized collection kits designed for blood or saliva. These samples are then transported to the laboratory, where they undergo analysis using the LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography with Tandem Mass Spectrometry) machine.

The instrument produces detailed measurements which are compiled and presented to a trained technician. The technician reviews the results to make a positive or negative determination based on the presence or absence of prohibited substances.

Analyzing LC-MS/MS results is time-consuming, and the goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can automate this process and save valuable time by making accurate predictions independently.
